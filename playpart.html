    <p>SOLNESS.

        [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
        that you?
        
        
        KAIA.
        
        I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
        
        
        SOLNESS.
        
        Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
        
        
        KAIA.
        
        No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
        coming presently to hear--
        
        
        SOLNESS.
        
        How is the old man to-day?
        
        
        KAIA.
        
        Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
        to-day.
        
        
        SOLNESS.
        
        Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
